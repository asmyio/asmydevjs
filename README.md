# asmy.dev

my website in React, I just wanna show off that I can do React because sometimes interviewers would ask for a JavaScript project to see that I could code in JavaScript, hence, where else would be the best place to show off unless it is my website :smile:

## Goals 

- To show off proficiency in JavaScript & TypeScript 
- Demonstrate creativity in frontend and backend development
- Get the job that I'm applying for, hopefully.

## Features

- [x] Interactive Terminal
- [] Interactive Resume
- [] Chatbox
- [] Mini Games
- [] Projects
